unit-like structs:  structs without any field or method   (ch10) 
define references as type of struct fileds      (ch10)

*****
automatic dereferencing and referencing:
both below are the same:   (unlike c++, obj->func not exists in rust)
    p1.distance(&p2);
    (&p1).distance(&p2);



Non-associated methods (inside impl, without &self):

impl Rectangle {
    fn square(size: u32) -> Self {
        Self {
            width: size,
            height: size,
        }
    }
}
